# Local Review

An IntelliJ Platform plugin that adds GitHub-style "reviewed" checkmarks to the
Commit / Local Changes view, with automatic invalidation when a file changes after
being marked.

<!-- Plugin description -->
**Local Review** brings GitHub's "Viewed" checkbox to IntelliJ's Commit / Local Changes
view — so you can keep track of which files in your working tree you've already reviewed.

It's designed for reviewing AI-generated, auto-refactored, or machine-edited code locally:
mark a file as reviewed, and if a code-gen tool, formatter, or your own editor touches
it again, the mark drops automatically so you don't miss the new churn.

**Features**

- Mark / unmark files as reviewed from the Commit tool window, an editor tab,
  the editor itself, or the Project View.
- `To review (N)` and `Reviewed N of M · XX%` synthetic groups in Local Changes
  give at-a-glance progress.
- Inline ✓ badge on reviewed rows.
- Auto-invalidation on any document edit, save, or external file change.
- State is per-project, per-branch, stored locally in `.idea/cache/` — never leaks
  into commits.
- Configurable TTL and per-branch cap keep state bounded.
- Works across the IntelliJ Platform: IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand, Android Studio, ...

**Getting started**

Install the plugin, open any project with a Git working tree, then open the Commit
tool window. Right-click any changed or unversioned file and pick **Mark as Reviewed**,
or press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V` (`⌘⌥⇧V` on macOS). Edit the file later and the mark drops
automatically. Configure retention and cap under **Settings → Tools → Local Review**.

## Installation

_(Pending first release to JetBrains Marketplace.)_

Until then, build locally:

```
./gradlew buildPlugin
```

The plugin zip lands in `build/distributions/`. Install it via
**Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk…**

## Keyboard shortcut

`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V` (macOS: `⌘⌥⇧V`) toggles the reviewed mark on the current selection.

## Settings

Under **Settings → Tools → Local Review**:

- TTL (days) — forget reviewed marks older than this.
- Per-branch cap — evict oldest marks when a branch exceeds it.
- Enable debug logging (restart required).

## Development

```
./gradlew runIde           # launches a sandbox IDE with the plugin
./gradlew test             # runs the headless test suite (unit + integration)
./gradlew verifyPlugin     # runs JetBrains Plugin Verifier across target IDEs
./gradlew buildPlugin      # produces the distributable zip
```

### Tests

Two layers of regression coverage:

1. **Headless tests** (`./gradlew test`) — default, fast, deterministic.
   - *Unit tests* for `ContentHasher`, `Key`, `State` round-trip, `ReviewStateService`.
   - *Light-platform tests* for the service's PSC behavior via `BasePlatformTestCase`.
   - *Integration tests* in `src/test/kotlin/com/localreview/integration/` cover the
     end-to-end invalidation flows (mark → document edit → mark drops, mark → VFS save
     with different content → mark drops, same content → mark stays, etc.) using the
     real `EditorFactory`, `VirtualFileManager`, and `ChangeListManager`.

2. **Remote Robot UI smoke tests** (`./gradlew uiTest`) — slow, last-line safety net.
   Exercise a real sandbox IDE over HTTP via the JetBrains Remote Robot framework.
   Run in two terminals:

   ```
   # Terminal 1
   ./gradlew runIdeForUiTests

   # Terminal 2 — once the IDE window is up
   ./gradlew uiTest
   ```

   The current smoke suite checks that the action is registered, the plugin's
   application service is instantiable, and the bundle strings render correctly.
   Extend `src/uiTest/kotlin/.../LocalReviewUiSmokeTest.kt` for richer flows.

   CI runs these too — see the `ui-tests` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It
   installs Xvfb, launches the IDE in the background, waits for the Robot port
   to become reachable, runs the tests, and uploads the IDE log + any screenshots
   on failure. The job is marked `continue-on-error: true` so UI flakiness doesn't
   block merges — flip that off once the suite stabilises.
